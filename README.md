# lp
Get started with LINQPad and the lprun cli scripting environment with one file.

Clone the repo or download the setup.bat file, and from the command line, run:

```
.\setup.bat
```

Once everything is up and running, optionally add the directory to your path variable to easily run your scripts.

Refer to the [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) and [lprun](https://www.linqpad.net/lprun.aspx) documentation for more information.
